# OrderedMap
## Description
An implementation of an orderd map in JS.
## How to use
Modern JS supports [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) object, which is useful in a lot of cases as a fast associative key - value storage. However it doesn't support ordering by keys. OrderedMap adds this functionality, it supports all the methods that a normal Map has and is compatible with it, with the only limitation that the iteration is not guaranteed to be correct when the map is modified during iteration (this is a performance and memory usage tradeoff, I might work on this in the future).

It adds additional functionality that keeps the keys ordered.

### Methods / properties
* ```constructor()```
    #### Description
	The OrderedMap constructor.
	#### Signatures
	```
	constructor()
	constructor(iterable)
	constructor(comporatorFn)
	constructor(iterable, comporatorFn)
	```
	```iterable``` is an Array or other iterable object whose elements are key-value pairs. (For example, arrays with two elements, such as ```[[ 1, 'one' ],[ 2, 'two' ]]```).

	```comporatorFn``` is a custom function that determines the order of the elements, it works exactly like the passed callback in [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort). 
	
	If the only argument is a function (```typeof arg === 'function'```) it will be recognized as comporator, otherwise as an iterator.
	___
* ```size```
	#### Description
	The number of elements in this map.
	___
* ```has(key)```
	#### Description
	Checks if a given key exists in the map. Returns ```true``` if present or ```false``` if not.
___
* ```get(key)```
	#### Description
	Searches for a given key. Returns the associated value if present or ```undefined``` if not.
	___
* ```set(key, value)```
	#### Description
	Associates the given key with value. Returns the map object itself.
	___
* ```getNth(index)```
	#### Description
	Searches for a value with its key ordering index. Returns the value if present or ```undefined``` if not. If ```index``` is negative the n-th from the end is taken (i.e. -1 means the last, -2 means the second last, etc.).
	___
* ```getNthKey(index)```
	#### Description
	Searches for a key with an ordering index. Returns the key if present or ```undefined``` if not. If ```index``` is negative the n-th from the end is taken (i.e. -1 means the last, -2 means the second last, etc.).
	___
* ```getNthEntry(index)```
	#### Description
	Searches for a ```[key, value]``` pair with an ordering index. Returns the pair if present or ```undefined``` if not. If ```index``` is negative the n-th from the end is taken (i.e. -1 means the last, -2 means the second last, etc.).
	___
* ```getIndex(key)```
 	#### Signatures
	```
	getIndex(key)
	getIndex(key, isUpperBound)
	```
	#### Description
	Returns the index of the closest less or equal key or the greater or equal key. If no such key is found ```-1``` is retuned.
	
	```key``` is the searched key. 
	
	```isUpperBound``` is ```false``` by default. If it is ```false``` the closest less or equal key index is searched, otherwise the greater or equal key index.
	___
	```count``` is the maximum number of keys that should be taken, if ommitted all the available keys are taken. If ```count``` is negative the iteration order is reversed from the starting index.
	___
* ```getClosestKey(key)```
 	#### Signatures
	```
	getClosestKey(key)
	getClosestKey(key, isUpperBound)

	```key``` is the key that the closest key is searched for.
	
	```isUpperBound``` is ```false``` by default. If it is ```false``` the closest less or equal key is searched, otherwise the greater or equal closest key.

	```canMatch``` is ```true``` by default. If it's ```false``` only strictly smaller or greater keys are searched.
	___
* ```getClosestValue(key)```
 	#### Signatures
	```
	getClosestValue(key)
	getClosestValue(key, isUpperBound)
	getClosestValue(key, isUpperBound, canMatch)
	```
	#### Description
	Searches for the closest key. Returns the associated value if the key exists or ```undefined``` if not.

	#### Description
	Searches for the closest key. Returns the associated entry (```[key, value]``` pair) if the key exists or ```undefined``` if not.

	```key``` is the key that the closest key is searched for.
	
	```isUpperBound``` is ```false``` by default. If it is ```false``` the closest less or equal key is searched, otherwise the greater or equal closest key.

### Static Methods / properties
* ```groupBy()```
	#### Signatures
	```
	groupBy(iterable, callbackFn)
	groupBy(iterable, callbackFn, comporatorFn)
	```
	#### Description
	Groups the elements of a given iterable using the values returned by a provided callback function. The final returned OrderedMap uses the unique values from the test function as keys, which can be used to get the array of elements in each group.


	```iterable``` is an iterable (such as an Array) whose elements will be grouped.

	```callbackFn(element, index)``` is a function to execute for each element in the iterable. It should return a value (object or primitive) indicating the group of the current element.

	```element``` is current element being processed.

	```index``` is the index of the current element being processed.

	```comporatorFn``` is a custom function that determines the order of the elements, it works exactly like the passed callback in [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort). 

## Algorithmic complexity (worst case)
| Operation | Complexity|
| :---:   | :---: |
| Search | `log(n)`   |
| Insertion | `log(n)`   |
| Deletion | `log(n)`   |
| Construction from generic iterable / groupBy() | `n * log(n)`   |
| Construction from another OrderedMap (with the same comporator) | `n`  |
| Searching n-th key / value / entry | `log(n)`  |
| Searching closest key / value / entry | `log(n)`  |
| Finding the key index | `log(n)`  |
| Iteration from k-th entry | `count + log(n)`|
